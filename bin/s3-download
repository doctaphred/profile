# A nicer way to download files from s3, preserving their prefixes.
#
# Args:
# $1: local base directory
# $2: prefix (including bucket name)
#
# Additional args are forwarded to the `aws s3 sync` command.
#
# Default forwarded args include `--exclude '*'`, so you **must**
# provide `--include` and a value in order to do anything.
# (Use `--include '*'` to download all contents.)

set -x
mkdir -p "$1/$2/"
# Include the full prefix -- not just the bucket name -- in the s3 url,
# to avoid horrendously slow performance for large buckets.
aws s3 sync "s3://$2/" "$1/$2/" --exclude '*' "$@"
